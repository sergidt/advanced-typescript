<h3>Façade</h3>

<p>The Façade Pattern organizes subsystems and provides a unified higher-level interface. An
    example that might be familiar to you is a modular system. In JavaScript (and of course
    TypeScript), people use modules to organize code. A modular system makes projects easier
    to maintain, as a clean project structure can help reveal the interconnections among
    different parts of the project.</p>

<p>It is common that one project gets referenced by others, but obviously the project that
    references other projects doesn't and shouldn't care much about the inner structures of its
    dependencies. Thus a façade can be introduced for a dependency project to provide a
    higher-level API and expose what really matters to its dependents.</p>

<p>Take a robot as an example. People who build a robot and its components will need to
    control every part separately and let them cooperate at the same time. However, people
    who want to use this robot would only need to send simple commands like “walk” and
    “jump”.
    For the most flexible usage, the robot “SDK” can provide classes like MotionController,
    FeedbackController, Thigh, Shank, Foot and so on. Possibly like the following image
    shows:</p>

<b>Participants</b><br>
The participants of Facade Pattern include:
<ul>
    <li><b>Façade:</b> Robot. Defines a set of higher-level interfaces, and makes subsystems cooperate.</li>
    <li><b>Subsystems:</b> MotionController, FeedbackController, Thigh, Shank and Foot</li>
</ul>
