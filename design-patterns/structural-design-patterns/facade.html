<h3>Façade</h3>

<p>The Façade Pattern organizes subsystems and provides a unified higher-level interface. An
    example that might be familiar to you is a modular system. In JavaScript (and of course
    TypeScript), people use modules to organize code. A modular system makes projects easier
    to maintain, as a clean project structure can help reveal the interconnections among
    different parts of the project.</p>

<p>It is common that one project gets referenced by others, but obviously the project that
    references other projects doesn't and shouldn't care much about the inner structures of its
    dependencies. Thus a façade can be introduced for a dependency project to provide a
    higher-level API and expose what really matters to its dependents.</p>
